## 📥 Installation & Usage
1. 📂 Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. 🌐 Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. 🖱️ Hover over the names to see the image appear and move with the cursor.

## 🏗️ How It Works
- The HTML structure consists of multiple `div` elements, each containing a name and an image.
- 🎨 CSS is used for styling and initial hidden positioning of images.
- ⚡ JavaScript handles the hover effect and makes the images appear when hovering over the name, and move along with the cursor.

## 📝 JavaScript Explanation
- `mouseenter` event: Displays the image. 🖼️
- `mouseleave` event: Hides the image. 🔄
- `mousemove` event: Moves the image according to the cursor position. 🎯

## 🎨 Customization
- You can add more names and images by following the existing structure. 📌
- Modify the CSS styles for different animations or effects. 🎭
- Change the font by replacing `gilroy-bold.ttf` with another font of your choice. 🔤
